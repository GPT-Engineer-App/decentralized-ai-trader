# decentralized-ai-trader

Create a fully functional autonomous AI agent that can analyze market data, make investment decisions, and execute trades in a decentralized manner that can be hosted on github pages. This agent must leverage large language models (LLMs) in a loop, continuously monitoring market conditions and adjusting its strategies accordingly. It must also utilize tools like web search and data APIs to gather relevant information for its decision-making process.
